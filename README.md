# Assessment_project
These are some machine learning small projects I did for assessment of a company. 


okay so the tasts I chose are 
1. spam sms detection system:
   
  I have been provided dataset from kaggle that is publically available to use.
  for this task we will use NLP for sure. I have tried to divide the process in part.
  normal cycle of deep learning models that contains. data preprocessing, feature extraction and tokenization, then classifiers for the prediction.
  I will be using some ML algorithms that can help in improving the classification and choosing one model as final for the submission 


  THINGS TO REMEMBER RELATE TO THIS PROJECT : 
  a. The spams tend to be longer than normal emails/ texts
  


   
3. Credit card fraud detection:
